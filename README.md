# Binary Classification of Pass/Fail Exam Score
This Java application implements a simple Perceptron neural network to predict whether a student passes or fails based on their math, science, and English scores.

## Features
• Add Data: Allows the user to input new student scores and whether they passed or failed.

• Train: Trains the Perceptron model using the provided training data with adjustable learning rate and number of epochs.

• Predict: Predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on their input scores.

• Accuracy Calculation: Displays the accuracy of the trained model based on the training data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
• Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

• IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) for Java development.

## Installation
• Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Omar-Raddad/Binary-Classification-of-Pass-Fail-Exam-Score.git

cd Binary-Classification-of-Pass-Fail-Exam-Score

• Open the project in your IDE.

## Usage
• Run PerceptronGUI.java to start the application.

• Enter student scores for math, science, and English.

• Click Add Data to add the student data to the training set.

• Adjust the Learning Rate, Epochs, and Accuracy Goal parameters as needed.

• Click Train to train the Perceptron model.

• Use Predict to predict the pass/fail outcome based on new student scores.
